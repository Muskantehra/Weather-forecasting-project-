# Weather Forecasting Using ARIMA and Linear Regression

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict short-term temperature patterns using time series forecasting techniques. It explores the performance of two models—*ARIMA* and *Linear Regression—on historical weather data collected for London from **1980 to 2010*. The goal is to identify the most accurate method for temperature forecasting and understand seasonal patterns.

## Dataset
The dataset used consists of historical daily temperature readings in London.

*Sources:*
- TempForecast_London_1980_2010.csv – Historical temperature dataset.
- temperature_forecasts_1990.csv – Predicted temperature output generated by the models.

## Models Used

- *ARIMA*: A time series model used for forecasting based on autocorrelations and past values. Parameters are selected based on AIC/BIC scores.
- *Linear Regression*: Applied after extracting temporal features (e.g., day, month, trend) from the dataset.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Muskantehra/Weather-forecasting-project.git
   cd Weather-forecasting-project

 2.	Install required libraries:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels scikit-learn

3.	Run the Jupyter notebook or Python file:
	•	Temperature_Forecasting_with_ARIMA_and_Linear_Regression.ipynb for step-by-step analysis.
	•	temperature_forecasting_with_arima_and_linear_regression.py for a script-based run.

⸻

𝑹𝒆𝒔𝒖𝒍𝒕𝒔
	•	ARIMA model performed better in capturing time-based seasonal trends.
	•	Linear Regression offered faster computation but showed slightly higher residual error.
	•	Visualizations include trend decomposition, residual plots, and actual vs. predicted graphs.

𝙁𝙪𝙩𝙪𝙧𝙚 𝙒𝙤𝙧𝙠
	•	Integrate more features like humidity, pressure, and wind speed.
	•	Use advanced models like LSTM or Facebook Prophet for long-term forecasting.
	•	Test model performance on different cities for comparison.
